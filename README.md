How to Use

Make a project folder and place index.html and style.css inside.

Add an images/ folder and include the image files referenced in the HTML, or swap filenames inside the file.



Open capstone.html in any modern browser to preview the site.

(Optional) Upload the folder to GitHub and activate GitHub Pages to host it online.

Customization Tips

Replace placeholders in /images with high-quality compressed images (Unsplash works great).

Sticky nav uses a dual-header trick: one transparent header over the hero, and one solid header that becomes visible after scrolling — no JavaScript needed.
